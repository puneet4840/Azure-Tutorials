# Basics of Cloud Computing, Vocabulary and Terinology-

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of computing resources, such as Storage, Servers, Networking, Databases, Software, Analytics and Intelligence, etc, over the internet.

### What is Cloud?

_Accessing a Data Center remotely is called cloud._

Cloud is the platform which provides on demand delivery of computing resources such as Storage, Networking, Databases, Software, Analytics and Intelligence, etc.

### Why do we need cloud?

We know that if we have an application we need a server to expose that application to outside world.

- **What is Server?**

  Server is a remote computer which has Local Storage, CPU and RAM. These servers are used to run application.

So, 10 or 15 years back companies like Google, Yahoo procure the servers from vendors like IBM, HP, etc. These companies used to procure 100's of servers from vendors. To manage these servers companies had particular System Administrators which mangage these server. 

After few years back companies have their own servers. Procuring the servers from vendors used to seems expensive. So companies decided get their own servers.

- Example of Google:

  Google installed 100's or 1000's server inside the racks in its server rooms. These servers are connected through High Speed cables, Switches or Routers. This complete setup is called **_Data Centre_**.

### Private Cloud Concept

_A Data Center is the Private Cloud._

If a company have their own data center so that data center is the private cloud for that company.

Nowdays every company has its own data center which we also call private cloud.

Some companies hire the servers from vendors like IBM, HP. So that servers is also the private cloud for companies, which only that company can use no other company can use it.

### Public Cloud Concept

Now Amazon or Microsoft came into the picture and start AWS and Azure cloud plaforms. Amazon and Microsft have built their data center all over the world and started offering on-demand servers. 

Big companies like Google can afford their own private cloud (Data Center), but mid-scale companies cannot, so this public cloud option has been started for those mid-scale companies.

- **Data Center**: Collection of servers connected with each other is called Data Center.

# What is Servesless?

ServerLess is the cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocate resources to run your code.

As a developer, you only focus on writing and deploying code, without worrying about managing servers, scaling or operating systems. 

Despite its name, ```serverless``` does not mean there are no servers. Instead, it means **you don't have to manage servers** - the cloud provider takes care of all server realted tasks.

Serverless computing is an application development model where you can build and run applications without having to manage servers. It means you can build run applications on the third-party managed server infrastructure.

You need to pay only for the exact amount of resources used by your application.

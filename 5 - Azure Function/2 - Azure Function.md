# Azure Function

Azure Function is the **cloud-based service** by microsoft that allows you to run small piece of code (called "functions") without worrying about servers and infrastructure.

**Azure Functions** is a **serverless compute service**. Serverless means:
- You write code, and Azure handles infrastructure (servers, scaling, and maintenance).
- The code is triggered by external events or schedules.
- Itâ€™s ideal for short-running, event-driven tasks like data processing, event handling, or microservices.

## Why use Azure Functions?

- **Event-Driven**: Functions execute in response to triggers like HTTP requests, timer schedules, or messages in a queue.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales based on demand.
- **Cost-Effective**: You pay only for the time your function runs.

## Function App Architecture

In the above architecture you can see that when we create a Function App on azure the following steps has been followed by azure:
- Select the Azure Data Center based on your region choice.
- It selects a physical server inside the data center.
- Create a Virtual Machine in the physical server based on your choice between Linux or Windows and assign it for function app.
- Create a Function App inside the VM, that is the Serverless. We only able to see our function but azure has create that Function app inside the virtual machine.
- If we want to create multiple same os related function apps so we can create it.

Here, Serverless means there is azure managed server on which you function app is create by azure. Azure scales or de-scales it based on the load on your function app.

This is the concept of serverless.

## Components of Azure Function

- **Function App**:

  The Function App is a container that holds one or more Azure Functions. All functions in a Function App share:
  - Runtime and configurations.
  - Deployment settings.

- **Trigger**:

  Trigger defines how the function is invoked. A trigger is what causes your function to execute. Types include:

  - **HTTP Trigger**: A Function executes when an HTTP request is received.
  - **Timer Trigger**: Function runs based on a scheduled time in cron syntax.
  - **Blob Trigger**: Runs when a new file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
  - **Queue Trigger**: Executes when a message is added to a queue.
 
- **Input Binding**:

  Input bindings provide data to the function when it executes. For example:
  - Reading data from a SQL database or Azure Storage Blob.

- **Output Binding**:

  Output bindings send data from the function to an external service. For example:
  - Writing messages to a queue or saving files to Blob Storage.

- **Runtime**:

  The runtime is the execution environment for Azure Functions, available in:
  - .Net, Python, Java, PowerShell and more.

## Azure Function Pricing Models

There are three types of pricing models in Function app:

- **Consumtion Plan**:

  - It is default hosting plan.
  - You Pay only when your function is running.
  - Scales automatically, even during periods of high load. Instances of the functions host are added or removed based on the number of incoming events.
  - In the consumption plan, Virtual Machine allocated for the Function App has maximum 100 CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM.
  - Azure can add maximum of 200 function app instances in the consumption plan and every instance has 100 CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM.
  - When the load increases on function app, azure automatically adds an vm instance on which you same function app run.
  - Function app in the consumption might be slow due to cold start.

- **Premium Plan**:

  - Provides pre-warmed instances that are always available, minimizing cold starts and latency.
  - Function runs on more powerful instances with dedicated resources (vCPUs and memory).
  - Provides more CPU and Memory options than what is provided in the consumption plan.
  - You can run your code longer than maximum execution time is allowed on the consumption plan.
  - Allows you to connect your function app to your Azure Virtual Network for secure access to resources.
  - In the Premium plan, Virtual Machine allocated for the Function App has 210-840 CPU and 3.5 GB - 14 GB of RAM.
  - Azure can add maximum of 100 function app instances in the Premium plan.

- **App Service Plan**:

  - Runs your functions on dedicated virtual machines, giving you full control over the underlying infrastructure.
  - You're charged for the VM instances you allocate, regardless of function executions.
  - Provides access to features like custom domains, SSL certificates, and scaling options available in Azure App Service.
  - You have existing and underutilized virtual machines that are already running other App Service instances.

# Azure Function

Azure Function is the **cloud-based service** by microsoft that allows you to run small piece of code (called "functions") without worrying about servers and infrastructure.

**Azure Functions** is a **serverless compute service**. Serverless means:
- You write code, and Azure handles infrastructure (servers, scaling, and maintenance).
- The code is triggered by external events or schedules.
- Itâ€™s ideal for short-running, event-driven tasks like data processing, event handling, or microservices.

### Why use Azure Functions?

- **Event-Driven**: Functions execute in response to triggers like HTTP requests, timer schedules, or messages in a queue.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales based on demand.
- **Cost-Effective**: You pay only for the time your function runs.
